  - **Soft Deletes**: Data preservation structure.

- **🎨 Modern UI/UX**

## 🤖 AI Assistance
AI agents were used as architectural assistants and implementation accelerators, while all core design decisions, data modeling, and system integration were authored, validated, and owned by the developer. The agents assisted with:
-   **Clean Architecture** design.
-   **Full-stack implementation** (React + .NET).
-   **Debugging and Refactoring** complex logic.
-   **Security auditing** (RBAC & Anonymization).
